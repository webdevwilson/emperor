title: Release of Milestone 0.0.17
description: emperor release 0.0.17 knockout javascript ticket linking pagination
---

I was away for an office visit last week and Emperor was rested. This week
I've come back with gusto.

## Invisible Features

The primary difference in this release &mdash; and the place where bugs will
likely be found &mdash; is adoption of [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) for
the heavy JavaScript lifting. I suspect that there will be more changes in the
future both in terms of client-side features and API changes.

Emperor also now tracks the last few tickets you've viewed in your session
to facilitate future features.

## Improved Ticket Linking

Emperor's "linker" was really great at building up a collection of links.  It
was bad, however, at making one-off links.  I feel that links are a very
important bit of metadata so the linking functionality has been changed to
to a more traditional dialog:

The ticket input autocompletes as you type to speed up entry.  Expect this
feature to improve.

## Pagination

Emperor's pagination control was [buggy](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-157)
and unfriendly.  This release improves the control in three ways:

* The listing of pages is now abbreviated to a manageable size.
* The list of pages is "windowed" to show a few pages on either side of the current one.
* Links are present (when applicable) to just to the first or last page.

## Continued Project Improvements

The project page receives a bit more work with quick links to all tickets or just the open ones:

## And More

The JavaScript changes consumed most of the time for this sprint, so there are not
many other changes.  Feel free to browse the [milestone for 0.0.17](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-160)
