title: Release of Milestone 0.0.23
description: emperor release 0.0.23 github commit linking search
---

I'm proud to release version 0.0.23 of Emperor this week, focusing on usability of commits and bugfixes related to search.

## Improved Commit Handling

Under the hood commits are just a special form of comment.  This was obvious
in the way Emperor showed them in the timline.  In 0.0.23 commits &mdash; and
other event types &mdash; are now differentiated and displayed differently.

## Linkable Comments &amp; Commits

With this improved display of comment types comes support for linking directly
to specific comments or commits. When you specify a comment or commit in the
url fragment, Emperor will highlight it for you.

## Other Miscellaneous Fixes

* Make user-initiated search-indexing (e.g. creating comments) [synchronous](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-213) so that they appear when a page refreshes.
* Rendered markdown content [no longer](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-214) has a preceding and following empty paragraph.  This was most obvious in the timeline and in comments.
* Fix [misattribution of comments](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-215) in the timeline.
* Clicking the icon of an event on the timeline [now links directly](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-217) to the comment or commit on the ticket page.
* The [API documentation](/docs/api/) has been updated.
