title: Release of Milestone 0.0.15
---

Another week and another feature-packed release of Emperor!

## Gravatar

This release contains the first use of [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com/) for user profile images.  It is only currently used on the redesigned project page.

## New Project Page

As Emperor's features develop I am able to start creating more useful views of tickets and projects.  In this case I've begun
building out a more featureful project page with a list of milestones, recent activity and information about the project's owner.

### Project Key Restrictions

Project keys &mdash; the short codes that identify a project &mdash; are now restricted in that they must:

* Start with a letter
* Otherwise contain only (unicode) letters or numbers

There is currently no length restriction, but that is [likely to change](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-146) since they are meant to be small.

## Markdown Improvements

The new markdown library [introduced in 0.0.14](http://emperorapp.com/2012/10/27/milestone-0014.html) has enabled the ability to link to other tickets and to link to users within ticket descriptions or comments.  You can [learn more about Emperor's markup syntax in the documentation](https://emperorapp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/EMP/Markup).

## Scala API Documentation

Did you know that Emperor already has the beginnings of an API for plugins? Some of the core functionality of Emperor is going to be moved to plugins in the near future.  This release is the first to come with [ScalaDoc for the API](http://emperorapp.com/docs/api/).

## And More!

This release sees improved date formatting, updates to [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) and some small i18n fixes.
