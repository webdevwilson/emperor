title: Mid-August Updates
---
Working on pacific time means that I have a lot more hacking time on weekday evenings, as I stay up much later. Emperor has directly benefited from this, with a big sprint being completed on Friday.  Version 0.0.6 has been tagged and the following features are there:

 * There is now an edit button on the ticket view page. (EMP-2)
 * A ticket's resolution status is now clearly shown on the ticket view page (EMP-3)
 * Reporter now defaults to the logged in user when creating a ticket (EMP-4)
 * Resolution status (via strikethrough) and summary are now shown in links (EMP-6)
 * Ticket creation now shows up in the timeline without a reindex (EMP-7)
 * Project is now listed as the first item in ticket creation and editing (EMP-8)
 * Revamp search results page to show more information (EMP-9)
 * Ticket links are now styled
 * Ticket links can now be removed (and have an API call)
 * Add more API docs (but they are still bad)
 * Change color of search filter buttons

I'm planning my next sprint now and it is likely to involve further link improvements and project-level settings for ticket attributes.
