Version 0.0.20 of Emperor contains some small fixes and some preparatory changes
for future enhancements.

## Small Fixes

The timeline shown for a user is now paginated. Filtering by user now shows
a proper translation in the search sidebar.

## Updates

Emperor now uses version 2.2.2 of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/),
version 1.8.2 of [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and version 0.20.1 of
[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org).  A few other libraries were
updated as well.  The ElasticSearch upgrade is now contained in the SBT project
file, so the libraries are no longer contained in the repository!

## Improvements

The Autocomplete for ticket linking has been completely rewritten.  In this
release it works exactly as the last, except that it allows you to link
multiple tickets at once, instead of just one a time.

This sets the stage for a much more featureful autocomplete in the future.

The [documentation for projects](https://emperorapp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/EMP/Projects)
has also been updated.
