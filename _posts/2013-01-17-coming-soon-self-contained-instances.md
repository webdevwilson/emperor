Some recent work has yielded the ability to download and run emperor with no
outside depencies, aside from the JVM.  The download is a bit big, clocking
in around 200MB due to the inclusion of [MySQL Connector MXJ](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-mxj/en/index.html).

This means that users who would like to test out Emperor or evaluate it will
have a lower barrier for entry.

I'm excited to release the first of these packages this weekend!
