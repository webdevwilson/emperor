Emperor was due for a round of fit and finish, so this release has focused on
getting core features more usable.  Here's the new stuff!

## Core Features Moved To Plugins

In addition to email notification Emperor's search indexing has now been moved
to a plugin that executes asynchronously from the web UI.  This will make some
actions in Emperor faster and helps to flesh out the plugin system.

## Improved Ticket View

Viewing a ticket is now more pleasant. The actions you can perform on a ticket
reside in a more obvious sidebar dropdown menu and the ticket's summary is now
the sole resident of the top of the content, with project name and ticket id
appearing just beneath.

## Timezones

Emperor stores all dates in [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
Users now have individual timezone settings and the UI displays (most) dates
in the user's preferred timezone.  The timezone will default to the default
timezone of your JVM, but it [can be changed](https://emperorapp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/EMP/Changing+The+Default+Timezone) to whatever you like.

## User Profile, Metadata &amp; <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>

Most places that show a user's name now link to a user profile.

In addition to this profile there are new fields for a user allowing location,
URL, organization and title.  Many places now show the user's gravatar as well.

## And More

Various bugs fixes and improvements are in tow, as well as improvements to
timelines, fixes that prevented new installations from working properly and
properly sorted comments on tickets. Feel free to browse the [milestone for
0.0.16](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-147) if you'd like to see more.
