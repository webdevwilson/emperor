title: Release of Milestone 0.0.7
---

Yesterday I completed work on Milestone 0.0.7 of Emperor.  This release was
a direct result of [dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)
Emperor for the last few weeks.

The creation of tickets has been improved to use project defaults. The ticket
linking interface has been improved. There were also a number of small UI improvements.

The entire list is here:

 * Add a project owner field (EMP-16)
 * Add project assignee strategies: unassigned or project owner
 * Show unresolved tickets on project page
 * Add JSON serialization for Ticket Priority
 * Add edit button to projects (EMP-17)
 * Add YUI model for Project
 * Remove old, unused templates
 * Add project-level defaults for various ticket fields (EMP-12)
 * Default to "current" project when creating a ticket from various places (EMP-5)
 * Change link remove icon to an x (EMP-21)
 * Revamp link display to be more awesome (EMP-14)
 * Increase size of textareas in ticket modals (EMP-20)
 * Update play version to 2.0.3
 * Update elasticsearch version to 0.19.9
 * Show (elided, if necessary) summary in link header (EMP-13)
 * Add (bad) comment UI. (EMP-19)
