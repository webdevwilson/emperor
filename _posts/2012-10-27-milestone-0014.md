title: Release of Milestone 0.0.14
---

After quite a hiatus I've tagged and release a new version of Emperor.  I took
some time to work on some other ideas and brought back some improvements from
those projects.  This release is small but it sets the stage for bigger
improvements in the future.

Here's the list of changes:
