title: Release of Milestone 0.0.14
description: emperor release 0.0.14 pegdown markdown improvement
---

After a short hiatus I've tagged and released a new version of Emperor.  I took
some time to work on some other projects and brought back some improvements.

## New Markdown Renderer

My favorite feature in this release is an improved Markdown renderer in the form
of [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown). This means that Emperor now
supports some Markdown improvements from
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/),
[PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) and
[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/). More than these
improvements, pegdown clears a path for adding other enhancements in the future.

## Change Summary

Here's the list of changes in 0.0.14:

* [EMP-79](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-79): Switch to pegdown
