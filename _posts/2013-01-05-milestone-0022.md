title: Release of Milestone 0.0.22

Version 0.0.22 of Emperor adds some new features that make it much more useful.

## User-Editable Profiles

Previously Emperor only allowed administrators to edit the profiles of users.
No more! A user can now edit their own profile by clicking Your Account on the
top right.

## Token Authentication

To facilitate API access Emperor now allows users to generate and revoke tokens
that can be used to access their account without exposing their username and
password.  These tokens are only safe when used with an SSL-secured Emperor.

## GitHub Integration

Emperor can now be integrated with GitHub!  Referencing ticket IDs in your commits
will show them in the new commits tab of the ticket.

I will be writing a blog post this week and writing documentation that explain
how to use this feature.  In the meantime you can take a look at [an example on the public instance of Emperor](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-206?tab=commits).

These features have me very excited about the future of Emperor.  I hope
you'll check it out.
