I'm proud to release version 0.0.24 of Emperor, focusing on the ticket defail page and API improvements.

## Improved Ticket Details

When viewing a ticket the sidebar now contains some useful information: the
number of days open and the number of days since the ticket was last changed.

<a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/0c292k2z2s2f3M3e0s22/Image%202013.01.27%203:44:26%20PM.png"><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 3px;" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0c292k2z2s2f3M3e0s22/Image%202013.01.27%203:44:26%20PM.png"></a>

It's unfortunately a bit broken for existing tickets. Unfortunately the create date
of existing tickets [was broken](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-222). There
was also [some trouble with timezones](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-223) that are now fixed.

The number of comments and commits are now displayed on the toolbar to give a
better indication of activity.

## Other Awesome Things

* Searching for an exact ticket id will [take you directly to that ticket](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-219), not to a search result.
* The "Links" area of the ticket info page is [no longer visible](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-59) unless there are links, on unless you add one.
* The Advance Ticket dialog is [no longer misaligned](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-221).
* A number of new API endpoints were created for [projects](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-226) as well as [ticket information and visible users](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-227).
* When adding a ticket Emperor adjusts the other inputs to match project defaults. This was temporarily broken and is [now repaired](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-220).
