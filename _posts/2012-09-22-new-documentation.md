title: New Documentation
---
Projects often live and breathe by their documentation. New users need the
documentation to become familiar with and earn trust in a project.

To that end I have [created new documentation for Emperor](https://emperorapp.atlassian.net)
today.  I've moved most of the existing documentation that was littered through
the source and moved it there.  I hope to steadily improve it over time in a
continued effort to create a great issue tracker.
