title: Release of Milestone 0.0.9
---

I'm really excited to tag version 0.0.9 of Emperor.  This sprint was all about
revamping the UI.  Having added many features it was time to take stock of the way things
were put together.  This release is packed with awesome features and I feel that Emperor
is coming very close to being a functional issue tracker.

Here's a list of changes:

* Revamp ticket UI (EMP-30)
* Improve comment UI (EMP-35)
* Show more ticket information: assignee, status, reporter, open date (EMP-27, EMP-28)
* Fix busted markdown rendering in ticket descriptions (EMP-38)
* Improve readability of ticket linker menu (EMP-39)
* Update to bootstrap 2.1.1 (EMP-30)
* Allow collapsing of link table in case it gets relaly long (EMP-44)
* Allow assignment outside of ticket editing (EMP-48)
* Fix bugs in history display of assignment changes (EMP-49)
* Show ticket "id" properly on some dialogs (EMP-45)

Here is a screenshot of the new ticket display screen:
