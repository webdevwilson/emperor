I'm proud to release version 0.0.25 of Emperor, focusing on updates to underlying dependencies and bug fixes.

## Scala and Play!

Scala 2.10.0 has been released and [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com) subsequently released version 2.1.0. A bit of migration was necessary and now future releases can make use of all the great features of modern Scala and Play!
