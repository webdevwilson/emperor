title: Release of Milestone 0.0.21
description: emperor release 0.0.21 improved linker
---

Version 0.0.21 of Emperor builds on the last release to improve the linking
of tickets.

## Linker Autocomplete

Linking tickets is an important feature, as creating connections between related
tickets increases their findability.  Emperor also doesn't have sub-tickets or
other parent-child relationships, instead relying on linking to handle this
type of connection.

The linker now works with ticket summarys and descriptions in addition to ticket IDs.
Keyboard arrow keys and enter now work for manipulating the list in addition
to mouse clicks.

The summaries of the tickets are displayed in the dropdown and recent tickets
shown at the bottom of the modal so that the act of browsing tickets can
contribute to the ability to quickly link.  The [documentation for linking tickets](https://emperorapp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/EMP/Linking+Tickets)
has been updated.
