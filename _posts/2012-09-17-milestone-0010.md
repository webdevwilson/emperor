title: Release of Milestone 0.0.10
---

This release of Emperor contains a singular feature that I think makes catapults
it far forward in usability for many users: Permissions!

Focused almost soley on permissions, 0.0.10 allows users to do the following:

* Permissions schemes that can be shared between projects.
* Allow anonymous users to browse projects.
* Limit which projects users (including anonymous!) can see.
* Limit the actions that users can perform.
* Control permissions based on groups and/or users.

The following permissions are currently available:

* Global login
* Global administrator
* Global project creation
* Per-project administration
* Project browsing (seeing tickets)
* Ticket commenting
* Ticket creation
* Ticket editing
* Ticket linking
* Ticket resolving

### The Big Deal

The best part of this release is that I can finally let everyone see a
<a href="http://issues.emperorapp.com">running version of Emperor</a>!  This is
emperor instance I use to plan my development and I think it is important that
this be public.  You can
<a href="http://issues.emperorapp.com/search?resolution=TICK_RESO_UNRESOLVED&amp;project=Emperor">look at all the outstanding tickets for Emperor</a>
or the <a href="http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-54">ticket for this release</a>.

### Next Steps

The permission work is exciting, but there's still some work to be done on the UI
for manipulating it.  I was so jazzed to release it that I stopped a bit short
in that area.  I intend to fix that in upcoming releases.

Here is a screenshot of the permission scheme screen:
