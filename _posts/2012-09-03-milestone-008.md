title: Release of Milestone 0.0.8
---

This is a small release targeting a single bug and a single improvements. It's
tagged as 0.0.8.1 because the original had a few bugs that got fixed after tagging.

There is now a footer that contains a few small improvements that I wanted to
put a fork in before beginning on a UI-focused sprint.

Here is a list of fixes:

 * Add footer with version, link and copyright. (EMP-22)
 * Clean up "no history" on history tab. (EMP-25)
 * Fix broken child link anchor tags. (EMP-24)
