title: 0.0.11 Sneak Peek And Docs

---
Last week I was in San Francisco for work and didn't have time to make progress
on Emperor, but I hope to make up for it by shipping a new version by the end
of this week.

To that end I finished the UI for granting and revokation in
permission schemes tonight.  Here's a sneak peek:

I've also taken some time to further improve the [documentation](https://emperorapp.atlassian.net/).
I'm excited about this feature and the others that I will be shipping!
