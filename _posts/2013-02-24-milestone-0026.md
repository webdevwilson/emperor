I'm proud to release version 0.0.26 of Emperor, focusing on bugfixes stemming from the recent Scala 2.10.0 and Play 2.1.0 upgrades.

## Header changes

Emperor's header has [been revamped](http://issues.emperorapp.com/ticket/EMP-250) and now adjusts at smaller resolutions to accomodate tablets and phones.
